### Overview

As issues crop up with installation and usage, fixes and workarounds will be included here...

### Cleaning a Prior Installation

Over the course of Prism's development we have modified elements of the installation. 
In order to provide a smooth upgrade for the latest Prism Studio tools, we have created 
[Prism Cleaner](../01-Installation/01-introduction.md), which much be installed and run before upgrading to the free plug-ins.

This tool cleans the prior installation and provides a log that can be provided to us to support any installation issues.
