### Micro-SD Card

For bounced/rendered sessions, the best way to transfer them to the Kasina is via the Micro-SD Card.

* To insert a card, **make sure its pins are facing up (towards the screen)**, and insert it into the **(9) MicroSD Reader** until
  the card clicks securely into place.

* To remove the card, use your finger nail and press in on the **MicroSD card** in the **(9) MicroSD Reader** until
  the card inside clicks and releases outward.

* The Kasina plays content in the form of either **.wav** or **.mp3** files loaded onto its **MicroSD card**.
  Cymatic Somatics content files have been created specifically to work with the Kasina. The **(9) MicroSD Reader**
  is accessed at the bottom of the unit. Folders are supported.
