### Usage
Prism Reference is useful when you want to stack multiple instances of Prism, in which case all but one instance should normally have the Reference Tone enabled.

This plug-in enables an alternate workflow, where Prism Reference can be applied to the master light encoding track while all Prism instances can simply
disable their Reference Tone generation. This avoids the situation where one must hunt down WHICH instance of Prism is producing the tone.

This plug-in is simply provided as a workflow convenience, and is not necessary if Prism is used to create the Reference Tone.
