### SpectraStrobe
`SpectraStrobe` is a technology used within the field of `AudioVisual Stimulation (AVS)` with
the intent of using sound and light to alter perception or behaviour. With SpectraStrobe, both light and
sound signals can be simultaneously encoded into a general stereo audio signal. When a SpectraStrobe signal
is consumed by a capable decoding device, light signals are typically routed to a pair of LED glasses
while the audio is typically routed to headphones.

### Similarities to AudioStrobe
SpectraStrobe shares similarities with other audiovisual encoding technologies such as `AudioStrobe`, but
it is a newer implementation that encodes more channels of color information. AudioStrobe is designed to
control LEDs that only have a single, fixed color. SpectraStrobe can control and mix a
full spectrum of color for each eye using separate `red`, `blue`, and `green` color channels/LEDs.

### Compatibility
When a SpectraStrobe or AudioStrobe encoded signal is played on a general audio device such as a CD player, 
computer, or mobile phone, the audio will play normally, and the light-specific signals will be inaudible. 
In this sense, SpectraStrobe and AudioStrobe signals are backwards compatible with any normal audio device.

Both technologies are also somewhat cross compatible: SpectraStrobe-capable devices can typically 
decode AudioStrobe content, and a subset of color control information from SpectraStrobe content will 
typically play back on AudioStrobe decoding devices, with varying results.
