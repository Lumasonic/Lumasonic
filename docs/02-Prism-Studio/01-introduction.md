### Getting Started

Prism Studio tools are [VST3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) plug-ins and must be used within a Digital Audio Workstation ([DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation)).

We recommend getting familiar with music production workflows (especially in regards to parameter automation) in 
your chosen DAW before working with Prism. Any DAW that supports VST3 plug-ins should work, but Prism Studio has 
been specifically tested with the following three:

* [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) (an affordable option that much of the Brainwave Entrainment community is rallying around) 
* [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/) (our primary production DAW)
* [Tracktion Waveform](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-free) (an excellent free choice)

To configure the plug-ins for your DAW, please see the [DAW Configuration Docs](03-daw-configuration.md).

To learn the basics of Prism VST, it's interface, and operation, you can visit the [Prism VST Overview](../03-Prism-VST/01-prism-plugin-overview.md) section.

Mixing considerations for your project, and rendering the final output to file is covered in the [Rendering & Output](../03-Prism-VST/07-rendering-output.md) section.
