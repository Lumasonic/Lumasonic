### Important Prerequisites
Before installing Prism Product Manager, it is vital to run [Prism Cleaner](01-introduction.md) if you have ever installed
a previous Prism release. This will ensure a clean starting point, free of leftover files and directories from all 
previous beta releases.

### Requirements
The requirements for running all Prism Studio plug-ins are listed below. All plug-ins are in the VST3 format and 
must be run within a supporting DAW.

#### Windows System Requirements
* `Windows 10 64 bit`
* `See your DAW's minimum system specs`

#### macOS System Requirements
* `macOS 64 bit (Intel or M1/M2)` version 10.15.7 or later
* `See your DAW's minimum system specs`

_**NOTE**: macOS native DAWs such as **Logic** often only support AudioUnit plug-ins natively, but you can use a VST3 wrapper product to
utilize Prism Studio tools within them. Alternatively, we suggest continuing your music production in your macOS
DAW of choice, and then utilizing **Reaper**, **Tracktion Waveform**, **Ableton Live**, or another VST3 supporting DAW to do
a visuals pass on your bounced track using Prism Studio tools._

### Installation
Please download the appropriate `PrismStudioFinalSetup` installer for your desired OS from the [binaries](../../binaries) folder.

Run the installer to install all Prism Studio plug-ins to the standard VST3 location for your OS (this will include `Prism`, `Prism Audio Bus`,
`Prism Monitor`, and `Prism Reference`).

Then follow the instructions laid out in the [Prism Studio](../02-Prism-Studio/01-introduction.md) docs to finish the configuration in your DAW.
